The People Search Application

Hi!  Welcome to the People Search application.  Just clone the repo and hit F5 and it's ready to go.  Some data has already been seeded so feel free to search without adding anything.

This application uses a .net WebApi backed with Entity Framework ORM.  The database is set to drop and recreate every time the application is started.  The front end is the latest version of Angular created and built using the Angular CLI.  The build output is committed in source control to facilitate starting the application as easily as possible. 

Thanks for looking!
